# Token-Based Authentication

This repo contains the code for one of my blogposts on Token-Based Authentication. If you have not read it you can do so [here](http://arthurmathies.com/2015/11/29/Authentication2/).

## Usage
If you want to play around with the code feel free to clone the repo.

In order to get the code to run you will need to set up a few things.

* run `npm install`

* Create a file named .env and add data of the following form to it. Obviously using your own data.

```
TOKEN_SECRET = "Your very secret token secret"
```

* start your server with `node server.js`

* open your Web browser on localhost:3000

You should be all set.
